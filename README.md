## Exercises
 1. Let's start with the basics - Write a program that finds all the prime numbers between a range that's entered by the user
 2. Blue or Red Pill?- Create a matrix with dimentions entered by the user, then fill it with random numbers. Print the sum, maximum, minimum and average of all the elements. Also, you should print the matrix values.
 3. Protect your privacy - Use the Caeser cypher to encrypt and decrypt a file, knowing the key
 4. Classes - Write a class named Shape. Write the classes Circle and Rectangle, which extend Shape. Write the class Square, which extends Rectangle. All the classes most have a method that calculates the area.
