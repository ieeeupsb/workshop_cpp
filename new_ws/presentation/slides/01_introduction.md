# A bit of history

 - C++, an extension of C, was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Laboratories.
 - It provides a number of features that "spruce up" the C language
 - But more importantly, it provides capabilities for **Object-Oriented Programming**.
 - It's an imperative programming language, which means it uses statements to change the programs state.
 - It's also a procedural programming language because the program is built from one or more functions (a function is the same as a procedure, it executes commands, but in addition, it returns a value).

# Object-Oriented Programming

- Objects are essentially reusable software components that model items in the real world.

# What C++ can do

 - C++'s greatest strength is how **scalable** it could be, so apps that are very resource intensive are usually built with it, like **3D Games**.
 - As a **statically typed** language, C++ is generally **more performant** than dynamically typed languages because the code is type-checked before it is executed.
 - Since you have **a lot of control over how your app uses resources**, your app can take up very little resource.
